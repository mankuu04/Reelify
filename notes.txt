                                                setup mongodb with next js

1.import the mongodb uri from the env file and check for any error
2. declare a variable that will store the connection from mongodb because
next js is running on edge so we don't know whether the connection is alrady established or not
3.you can get the cached connection from the global object like global.mongoose
but in global mongoose is not defined so we have to define it in the types.d.ts file
4. decalre a global variable in the types.d.ts file and inside it make a var mongoose it will be a object
which will store either the connection or promoise(that the connection is being established) or either null in both and these both will type of Connection and export it
5.now you cached connection will not show any error now if there is no cached then make it
6.let cached = global.mongoose;
7. if (!cached) {
  cached = global.mongoose = { conn: null, promise: null };
}
8.now make a function that will connect to the database and return the connection
9.first check whether the cached has conn if yes then return it
10. now check if cached has promoise if not then create one
    cached.promise = mongoose
      .connect(MONGODB_URI, opts)
      .then(() => mongoose.connection);

11.now make a trycatch inside try wait for the cached.promise to return and store it in the cached.conn
and inside catch first make the cached.promise null and then throw the error
12. now return the cached.conn
